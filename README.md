## [Seattle AirBNB Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

This is the project of Udacity's data scientist nanodegree program.
In this project, we are required to analysis data with ***CRISP-DM process***. The CRISP-DM process is below.

## Business Understanding:
Airbnb is a community-based online platform for listing and renting local homes. It connects hosts and travelers and facilitates the process of renting without owning any rooms itself. Moreover it cultivates a sharing-economy by allowing property owners to rent out private flats.

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AirBNB Data to better understand:
- What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle?
- Is there a busy season?
- Do some neighborhood have more listings than other? and dose it effect reviews?and what is average price per night?

### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

Numpy
Pandas
Seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot

### We have three datasets.

- listings: including full descriptions and average review score.
- calendar: including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
- reviews: including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
